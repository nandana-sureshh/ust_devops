Python Scripting

Scenario
--------
To find all the processes that uses more than 20% of the CPU
		--------------------------------------
		
When one process starts using too much of the CPU, the performance of the system slows down.
So, Identifying such processes can help to either terminate or kill the process inorder the restore the system performance.

STEPS
-----
Step1: Prime CPU% measurement
Step2: Short wait to allow actual CPU% to be calculated.
Step3: Set up the threshold limit.
Step4: Iterate through each process and filter the processes that uses CPU more that the threshold value.
